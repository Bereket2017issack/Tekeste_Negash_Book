      "On De\n",
      "cember 2,1950, the United Nations passed resolution 390A (V) on the fate \n",
      "of the former Italian colony of Eritrea. The said resolution which came to be \n",
      "known as the Federal Act stipulated that \"Eritrea shall constitute an autono-\n",
      "mous unit federated with Ethiopia under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian \n",
      "crown\". The resolution further stipulated that the Eritrean government would \n",
      "possess legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the field of domestic \n",
      "affairs. A United Nations Commissioner was simultaneously appointed to draft \n",
      "the Eritrean Constitution in consultation with the British Administering Autho-\n",
      "rity, the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean people.\n",
      "In pursuance of the UN resolution, the United Nations Commissioner super-\n",
      "vised the election of a Constituent Assembly, drafted a Constitution, witnessed \n",
      "its coming into effect, and wound up his responsibility when the Union Jack was \n",
      "replaced by the Eritrean and Ethiopian flags on September 15,1952. The feder-\n",
      "ation between Eritrea and Ethiopia had only a ten year lease of life; it came to an \n",
      "end on November 15,1962. A year earlier, Eritrean exiles in Cairo had formed \n",
      "an organization called the Eritrean Liberation Front.\n",
      "This study was conceived in the summer of 1988 when the war between the \n",
      "Eritrean nationalist forces and the Ethiopian state appeared to have reached a \n",
      "stalemate. The victory that the Eritreans scored at Afabet in the early months of \n",
      "1988 had brought to the attention of the leaders of Ethiopia that there was not \n",
      "going to be a military solution to the problem. The same view prevailed among \n",
      "the Eritrean camp even though this was camouflaged by the rhetoric of the \n",
      "Victory to the Masses. By 1988, the Eritrean war was entering its 28th year and \n",
      "was described as early as 1981 as Africa's longest war.\n",
      "However, as late as 1988 the causes of Africa's longest war were very ob-\n",
      "scure indeed. There were few studies on the period preceding the era of conflict \n",
      "and these were either biased or were inadequately documented. There was a \n",
      "clear predominance of the interpretation of the conflict that had been handed \n",
      "down by the Eritrean Liberation movements. In the search for a peaceful solu-\n",
      "tion, there was then a need for an exhaustive study on the period following \n",
      "Italian colonial rule, namely, 1941-62.\n",
      "Why did the UN come to the decision to unite Eritrea with Ethiopia? Impor-\n",
      "tant as this question might be, it has been of marginal interest as far as this study \n",
      "is concerned. Apart from the fact that the resolution of the Eritrean case by the \n",
      "UN falls very much under International Law rather than Eritrean history, we \n",
      "have sufficient though slightly biased studies on the subject. The impact of the \n",
      "British period on Eritrean society, however, needs to be closely looked at \n",
      "because of its relevance towards a better understanding of the background to \n",
      "the conflict and also because it forms part of Eritrean political and social history.\n",
      "10\n",
      "The period \n",
      "where our knowledge remained least developed was, however, \n",
      "that covering the federation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, 1952-62. The Eritrean \n",
      "parties were quick enough to denounce the Ethiopian government for violating \n",
      "the federation thereby providing a precipitant condition for the conflict. In con-\n",
      "trast the Ethiopian government remained with folded hands and watched the \n",
      "rewriting of an important part of the social and political history of the country \n",
      "by nationalist forces who by their nature were bound to twist and distort the \n",
      "past in order to suit their current objectives.\n",
      "By 1988 prospects for a political solution did not look positive; there did not \n",
      "exist the preconditions for a negotiated settlement. There was also an awareness \n",
      "that a military solution was not within reach. At the level of research, our know-\n",
      "ledge was extremely sketchy on far too many aspects of the conflict. The Eri-\n",
      "trean nationalist forces and the Ethiopian government believed strongly in the \n",
      "justness of their cases. These strong beliefs, made visible by the pursuance of \n",
      "Africa's longest war, were no doubt based on subjective perceptions of the back-\n",
      "ground, causes and nature of the conflict. Subjective perceptions about one's \n",
      "actions could, however, be altered through experience and above all through \n",
      "knowledge. The relevance of this study was, therefore predicated on the argu-\n",
      "ment that a negotiated settlement could hardly be expected without the exist-\n",
      "ence of a pool of knowledge on the subject available to both parties.\n",
      "In May 1991 the Eritrean nationalist forces together with other nationalist \n",
      "cum regionalist forces defeated the Ethiopian government forces and thus \n",
      "brought the 30 year long war to an end. Contrary to what many observers, \n",
      "including this author, had earlier believed, the Eritrean war was resolved mili-\n",
      "tarily.\n",
      "What is presented here is very much the story of the slow but steady disso-\n",
      "lution of the federation as seen and observed by the British diplomatic corps. \n",
      "Between 1952 and 1962, there were about 30 British nationals seconded to the \n",
      "Eritrean government. These expatriates kept in touch with the British Consu-\n",
      "late-General whose responsibility was to protect the interests of British nation-\n",
      "als as well as to report the developments to London. The conclusions and inter-\n",
      "pretations are, therefore, to a great extent based on that documentation with all \n",
      "the shortcomings inherent in such material.\n",
      "Moreover, this study is a reconstruction of Eritrean history from 1952 to \n",
      "1962. It is also a first attempt towards a synthesis. However, a more complete \n",
      "work of synthesis is several decades away due to the closeness of the period and \n",
      "the intensity with which some events and aspects are discussed. Furthermore, \n",
      "the ambiguities and ambivalences of the nationalist movement make it virtually \n",
      "impossible to even contemplate such a task. Yet the history of the federation has \n",
      "been told by a number of researchers; with very few exceptions these studies are \n",
      "either based on hearsay or on the ideologised interpretation of the Eritrean lib-\n",
      "eration organizations.\n",

      "weakness of the newly united state of Italy, interest in African colonies lay \n",
      "dormant until the beginning of the 1880s. The port of Assab, which had been \n",

      "was bought by the government in Rome in 1882. A few years later, the British, \n",
      "preferring Italy to France, encouraged and facilitated the Italian occupation of \n",

      "stretched over one thousand kms., the Italians felt more or less compelled to \n",
      "push their way up into the highlands where the climate is temperate. This timid \n",

      "Unable to penetrate to the highlands, the Italians, pursuing the next best \n",
      "strategy, began to expand northwest, namely to the Semhar and Sahel regions. \n",

      "dominant. The western lowlands were inhabited by numerous ethnic groups \n",

      "This policy of state financed settlement aroused considerable resistance from \n",

      "With his prior knowledge of Eritrea Ferdinando Martini was, however, \n",
      "determined to keep the colony for Italy, not so much for what the colony had to \n",
      "offer, but largely for prestige (Martini, 1913). As civilian governor, he toned \n",
      "down the military dimension and was intelligent enough to realize that a great \n",

      "By the time Ferdinando Martini left Eritrea (later to assume primary respon-\n",

      "the meanwhile the Italian administered colony continued to gain from Pax Ital- \n",

      "employment had begun to attract surplus manpower in the form of recruitment \n",
      "to the colonial army, a first contingent of which was sent to Somalia as early as \n",

      "It did not take many years for Governor Martini to assess the potential of the \n",

      "could do was to use Eritrea as an outlet for Ethiopian products (Martini, 1913). \n",
      "On the eve of their occupation of Ethiopia in 1935, up to 25 per cent of Ethiopian \n",

      "crises through food imports (Negash, 1987:151-153; cf. Iliffe, 1983; O'Connor, \n",

      "From the mid-1930s a combination of three factors further contributed \n",
      "towards the evolution of what may rightly be called the Eritrean consciousness. \n",
      "The first was the growing racist ideology which began to draw a distinction \n",
      "between the Eritreans who were fortunate enough to be under the civilizing \n",
      "umbrella of Italy and the inhabitants of the Ethiopian empire (Pollera, 1935; \n",
      "Negash, 1987). This policy, though devised to bolster Italian imperial or colonial \n",
      "ego, appeared to have trickled down to the Eritrean literati. The language of \n",
      "many Eritrean politicians in the 1940s betrays the pervasiveness of the colonial \n",

      "The second factor was the economic boom that Italy's war preparation against \n",
      "Ethiopia had created in Eritrea from 1932 onwards. The Italian population, \n",
      "which in 1934 accounted for not more than 4,600 souls (including infants) soon \n",
      "increased to exceed 50,000 by the end of 1935.* The amount of money and mate-\n",

      "with this second Italian invasion distinguished the Eritreans even further from \n",
      "the inhabitants of the Ethiopian Empire.\n",
      "Finally, the third factor was the Italo-Ethiopian War itself and the role the \n",
      "Eritreans were made to play, first in the actual conquering of Ethiopia and later \n",
      "in its pacification. Unable to pacify an empire, at least ten times as large as \n",
      "Eritrea, the Italians resorted to exhorting the Eritreans to continue with the \n",
      "admirable job of pacification. The first colonial army in Ethiopia was made up \n",
      "of slightly more than 50,000 Eritrean soldiers whose role was considered very \n",
      "crucial. In recognition of both the past and future contribution, Rome passed a \n",
      "decree in 1937 distinguishing the Eritreans from other subjects of the newly \n",

      "points of departure. The first one was the reluctance of the BMA officers in \n",
      "Eritrea to come to terms with an anti-colonialist movement in the form of the \n",
      "UP. In the early 1940s it was commonly believed that British rule in Africa \n",
      "would endure for many decades, if not centuries. The winds of change that \n",
      "began to blow soon after the independence of India in 1947 were in the case of \n",
      "Africa grudgingly acknowledged only in the middle of the 1950s. Therefore, it \n",
      "was much easier for a number of BMA officers, including Trevaskis, to look \n",
      "upon these as Ethiopian subversive activities rather than as the autonomous \n",
      "action of the UP in Eritrea. The UP was far ahead of its time.\n",
      "The British who were conducting a war and who were also beginning to \n",
      "evolve the restructuring of the map of Africa along ethnic lines were not pleased \n",
      "with this political cum cultural movement. The colonial ethos, after all, \n",
      "remained intact. So, no wonder that the British were not well disposed towards \n",
      "the Unionist Party. \"Among some British\", wrote Trevaskis, \"there was un-\n",
      "doubted resentment at the challenge to their authority (British power) implicit \n",
      "in Ethiopian pretensions and many British officers found it difficult to conceal \n",
      "their dislike of the bitter and touchy young men in the Mahber Fikri Hager\" \n",
      "[Unionist Partyl (Trevaskis, 1960:61).\n",
      "The second factor was most likely related to the policies the BMA pursued \n",
      "in the formation of public opinion in Eritrea. It was, for instance, the British who \n",
      "provided the initial impetus in 1943 for the formation of the Separatist move-\n",
      "ment that later emerged as the Liberal Progressive Party (LPP). It was also the \n",
      "British who twisted the arms of the Moslem leaders in Eritrea to form the \n",
      "Moslem League (ML) towards the end of 1946. Trevaskis, who during this \n",
      "period was in Eritrea and who no doubt was deeply involved in the formation \n",
      "of British policy in Eritrea, must have found it rather natural to perceive the \n",
      "Ethiopian state as playing a game similar to that of the BMA. Even if we were to \n",
      "concede that the Ethiopian government did indeed play a similar game, it \n",
      "would have required much more manpower and funds at its disposal. These \n",
      "were in short supply. Moreover, the available research on Ethiopian foreign\n",
      "32 Chapter On\n",
      "e\n",
      "policy of the period suggests that Ethiopia's main expectation was an outlet to \n",
      "the sea (Spencer, 1983; Tekle, 1964; Marcus, 1983).\n",
      "The third factor may well have been Trevaskis' profound knowledge of the \n",
      "role of the Ethiopian state in undermining the federal and autonomous status of \n",
      "Eritrea, facts widely known in the period when he was finalizing his book \n",
      "toward the end of 1958. There are strong reasons to believe that Trevaskis was \n",
      "reading history backwards, sometimes an irresistible temptation not only in the \n",
      "hands of amateurs but also among those trained in the historian's craft.\n",
      "One of the most pervasive impacts of the Trevaskian treatment of the UP has \n",
      "been that later historians have continued to treat the UP in the same fashion. \n",
      "Even historians who ought to be aware of the biases of colonial writers appear \n",
      "to have fallen victim to the eloquent, albeit mistaken, reconstruction of Tre-\n",
      "vaskis. The most important of these authors are discussed in the chapter dealing \n",
      "with Eritrean political parties. However the greatest impact of Trevaskis has \n",
      "been on the Eritrean Liberation Fronts which were determined to re-write his-\n",
      "tory. Like other nationalist movements elsewhere, the Eritrean organizations \n",
      "fighting for the establishment of an independent state continued to treat the \n",
      "Unionist Party as a movement which was hardly related to Eritrean history.1  \n",
      "Trevaskis' description of the Unionist Party suited perfectly the objectives of \n",
      "those Eritreans who either rejected the federation or regretted it afterwards.\n",
      "An examination of the British colonial sources, the local Eritrean sources, as \n",

      "despite the archival documentation leaving a great deal to be desired, and the \n",
      "deplorable fact that very few memoirs have been left behind, the available \n",
      "sources are sufficient to undertake a reconstruction of the Unionist Party and its \n",
      "role in the destiny of Eritrea.\n",
      "There is also another reason for paying particular attention to the political \n",
      "parties in general and the Unionist Party in particular. The events preceding the \n",
      "UN resolution, I believe, can be best understood when studied in the context of \n",
      "Eritrean political responses. Moreover, a study of the Eritrean political parties \n",
      "and their constantly shifting alliances provides a continuity as well as back-\n",
      "ground to the main theme of the book, namely the rise and the fall of the feder-\n",

      "The story of how the federation came into existence and the first three years \n",
      "of the life of the federation are treated in the third chapter. The documentation \n",

      "between the pre-federation agitation and post-federation protest can be clearly \n",
      "followed as well as established. The role of the Ethiopian government, firstly as \n",
      "a federal partner and secondly as the supreme authority over the country \n",
      "including Eritrea, is dealt with but perhaps not to the desired extent. It was more \n",
      "difficult for the British diplomatic corps to gather information inside Ethiopia \n",
      "since most of the decisions were taken by Emperor Haile Sellassie himself. \n",
      "Moreover, the Ethiopians did not have any serious worries as the federation was \n",

The said resolution which came to be \\nknown as the Federal Act stipulated that \"Eritrea shall constitute an autono-\\nmous unit federated with Ethiopia under the sovereignty of the Ethiopian \\ncrown\". The resolution further stipulated that the Eritrean government would \\npossess legislative, executive, and judicial powers in the field of domestic \\naffairs. A United Nations Commissioner was simultaneously appointed to draft \\nthe Eritrean Constitution in consultation with the British Administering Autho-\\nrity, the Ethiopian government and the Eritrean people.\\nIn pursuance of the UN resolution, the United Nations Commissioner super-\\nvised the election of a Constituent Assembly, drafted a Constitution, witnessed \\nits coming into effect, and wound up his responsibility when the Union Jack was \\nreplaced by the Eritrean and Ethiopian flags on September 15,1952. The feder-\\nation between Eritrea and Ethiopia had only a ten year lease of life; it came to an \\nend on November 15,1962. A year earlier, Eritrean exiles in Cairo had formed \\nan organization called the Eritrean Liberation Front.\\nThis study was conceived in the summer of 1988 when the war between the \\nEritrean nationalist forces and the Ethiopian state appeared to have reached a \\nstalemate. The victory that the Eritreans scored at Afabet in the early months of \\n1988 had brought to the attention of the leaders of Ethiopia that there was not \\ngoing to be a military solution to the problem. The same view prevailed among \\nthe Eritrean camp even though this was camouflaged by the rhetoric of the \\nVictory to the Masses. By 1988, the Eritrean war was entering its 28th year and \\nwas described as early as 1981 as Africa\\'s longest war.\\nHowever, as late as 1988 the causes of Africa\\'s longest war were very ob-\\nscure indeed. There were few studies on the period preceding the era of conflict \\nand these were either biased or were inadequately documented. There was a \\nclear predominance of the interpretation of the conflict that had been handed \\ndown by the Eritrean Liberation movements. In the search for a peaceful solu-\\ntion, there was then a need for an exhaustive study on the period following \\nItalian colonial rule, namely, 1941-62.\\nWhy did the UN come to the decision to unite Eritrea with Ethiopia? Impor-\\ntant as this question might be, it has been of marginal interest as far as this study \\nis concerned. Apart from the fact that the resolution of the Eritrean case by the \\nUN falls very much under International Law rather than Eritrean history, we \\nhave sufficient though slightly biased studies on the subject. The impact of the \\nBritish period on Eritrean society, however, needs to be closely looked at \\nbecause of its relevance towards a better understanding of the background to \\nthe conflict and also because it forms part of Eritrean political and social history.\\n10\\nThe period \\nwhere our knowledge remained least developed was, however, \\nthat covering the federation between Eritrea and Ethiopia, 1952-62. The Eritrean \\nparties were quick enough to denounce the Ethiopian government for violating \\nthe federation thereby providing a precipitant condition for the conflict. In con-\\ntrast the Ethiopian government remained with folded hands and watched the \\nrewriting of an important part of the social and political history of the country \\nby nationalist forces who by their nature were bound to twist and distort the \\npast in order to suit their current objectives.\\nBy 1988 prospects for a political solution did not look positive; there did not \\nexist the preconditions for a negotiated settlement. There was also an awareness \\nthat a military solution was not within reach. At the level of research, our know-\\nledge was extremely sketchy on far too many aspects of the conflict. The Eri-\\ntrean nationalist forces and the Ethiopian government believed strongly in the \\njustness of their cases. These strong beliefs, made visible by the pursuance of \\nAfrica\\'s longest war, were no doubt based on subjective perceptions of the back-\\nground, causes and nature of the conflict. Subjective perceptions about one\\'s \\nactions could, however, be altered through experience and above all through \\nknowledge. The relevance of this study was, therefore predicated on the argu-\\nment that a negotiated settlement could hardly be expected without the exist-\\nence of a pool of knowledge on the subject available to both parties.\\nIn May 1991 the Eritrean nationalist forces together with other nationalist \\ncum regionalist forces defeated the Ethiopian government forces and thus \\nbrought the 30 year long war to an end. Contrary to what many observers, \\nincluding this author, had earlier believed, the Eritrean war was resolved mili-\\ntarily.\\nWhat is presented here is very much the story of the slow but steady disso-\\nlution of the federation as seen and observed by the British diplomatic corps. \\nBetween 1952 and 1962, there were about 30 British nationals seconded to the \\nEritrean government. These expatriates kept in touch with the British Consu-\\nlate-General whose responsibility was to protect the interests of British nation-\\nals as well as to report the developments to London. The conclusions and inter-\\npretations are, therefore, to a great extent based on that documentation with all \\nthe shortcomings inherent in such material.\\nMoreover, this study is a reconstruction of Eritrean history from 1952 to \\n1962. It is also a first attempt towards a synthesis. However, a more complete \\nwork of synthesis is several decades away due to the closeness of the period and \\nthe intensity with which some events and aspects are discussed. Furthermore, \\nthe ambiguities and ambivalences of the nationalist movement make it virtually \\nimpossible to even contemplate such a task. Yet the history of the federation has \\nbeen told by a number of researchers; with very few exceptions these studies are \\neither based on hearsay or on the ideologised interpretation of the Eritrean lib-\\neration organizations.\\nFinally this study is the first of its kind to follow the rise and decline of the \\nfederation. The dangers inherent in undue reliance on semi-colonial and\\n11\\nentirely w\\nestern documentation notwithstanding, it is my firm belief that this \\nstudy can be seen as a challenge to young as well as veteran students of Eritrean \\naffairs.\\nIt is with pleasure tljat I acknowledge the institutions which contributed to \\nthe making of this book.

Partly due to lack of interest and to the inherent \\nweakness of the newly united state of Italy, interest in African colonies lay \\ndormant until the beginning of the 1880s. The port of Assab, which had been \\npurchased by a shipping company in a tacit agreement with the Savoy dynasty, \\nwas bought by the government in Rome in 1882. A few years later, the British, \\npreferring Italy to France, encouraged and facilitated the Italian occupation of \\nMassawa. Finding themselves owners of one of the hottest coastlines that \\nstretched over one thousand kms., the Italians felt more or less compelled to \\npush their way up into the highlands where the climate is temperate. This timid \\nattempt at expansion was nipped in the bud in the early months of 1887 by the \\nEthiopian state of the period, which had its centre in the northern part of the \\ncountry.\\nUnable to penetrate to the highlands, the Italians, pursuing the next best \\nstrategy, began to expand northwest, namely to the Semhar and Sahel regions. \\nBy the end of 1888, the Italians had established contacts with the Tigre, Habab \\nand Beni Amer leaders. They were preparing the ground for eventual coloniza-\\ntion by pushing protectorate treaties on the local leaders (Rubenson, 1976; Conti \\nRossini, 1935; Battaglia, 1958; Del Boca, 1976; Grassi & Goglia, 1981). By the end \\nof 1888, Italian possessions in the Red Sea area stretched over a thousand sq.km, \\nwith, however, virtually no hinterland, and quite rightly, the Italians used the \\nterm possessions to denote the vast area which they had just colonized. The area \\nfrom Massawa to Assab was different in every aspect from the area north of \\nMassawa up to the vicinity of Port Said in the Sudan\\nThe death of Emperor Yohannes (1889) and the shift of the centre of power \\nfrom Tigrai to Shewa created favourable conditions for Italian colonial expan-\\nsion. As early as 1887, Minilik, the King of Shoa, had expressed readiness to \\nnegotiate with the Italians for the supply of arms in exchange for a cession of ter-\\nritory, if this would ensure his speedy accession to power (Rubenson, 1976; \\nGebre Sellassie, 1975). Minilik seized the opportunity provided by the political \\nvacuum created by the death of Yohannes and sealed an Italo-Ethiopian pact,\\ni.e. the treaty of Wichale, in May 1889. A small area of northern Tigrai was thus \\nceded to Italy. In return the Italians agreed to supply him with arms and to \\nsupport his bid for the emperorship. However, since the treaty of Wichale had\\n14 Chapter One\\nto\\n be ratified by the Italian government, the Italians in Eritrea used the period \\nbetween the signing of the treaty and its formal ratification, which took place in \\nOctober, to expand their possessions well beyond the areas designated in the \\ndocument of May 1889. On January 1, 1890, these disparate possessions were \\nconsolidated into a single political entity henceforth to be known as Eritrea. For \\nthe first ten years of its life, the colony was administered by the Ministry of War \\nfrom the port town of Massawa.\\nEritrea contained ethnic and ecological diversity; a small part with Asmara \\nat its centre was the homeland of the Tigreans.1  Adherents of the Ethiopian \\nOrthodox Church, the Tigreans together with the Amhara and the Oromo of \\nWello were the main pillars of the Ethiopian/Abyssinian polity (Markakis, \\n1987; Erlich, 1982). Most Italian economic activities and most of the colonial \\ninfrastructure were to be found in the highland plateau where the Tigreans were \\ndominant. The western lowlands were inhabited by numerous ethnic groups \\nwith bitter memories of raid and plunder at the hands of Tigrean and Ethiopian \\nleaders. For Tigrean leaders the western lowlands were either a buffer zone or \\nno-man\\'s land. The Beni Amer, Habab, Mensa, Marya, Baza, Kunama, and Bilen \\nhad suffered greatly under Tigrean/Abyssinian plunder. The arrival of Italian \\nrule was highly welcomed (Negash, 1987). Islam was the dominant religion, fol-\\nlowed by small pockets of Catholic and Protestant followers. (Aren, 1978; Da \\nNembro, 1953). The Saho and the Afar occupied the eastern escarpment and the \\nlong southern coastline. Largely because of hostile ecology, the Saho and Afar \\nwere for the most part left on their own. (See ethnic map on page 17.)\\nOnce ensconced in the temperate zone, the Italians began to implement an \\nill-developed policy of settlement for landless peasants from southern Italy. \\nThis policy of state financed settlement aroused considerable resistance from \\nthe Eritrean peasantry which eventually led to a series of small scale wars with \\nEthiopia, culminating in the famous battle of Adwa in early March 1896 (Ruben- \\nson, 1976; Conti Rossini, 1935). The Italians lost over 4,600 of their co-nationals \\nin that one day battle. In the aftermath of the debacle, Italy renounced the treaty \\nwhich had given them a foothold in the highlands and the fate of their new \\ncolony hung in the balance.2\\nIn the new treaty of October 1896 signed with the victorious emperor Mini- \\nlik, the Italians were allowed to keep the territory which was delimited in 1890 \\nin return for a modest financial compensation (Martini, 1946, vol. 2, p. 350; Batt-\\n1  There is still no agreement as to the best designation. The present Eritrean government uses the  \\nterm Tigrinya to describe the same ethnic group. I have also earlier used the term Tigrinya.\\n2 The main cause of the battle of Adwa has hitherto been explained as a result of a controversy over  \\narticle XVII of the treaty of Wichale whereby Italy claimed that Ethiopia had consented to be an  \\nItalian protectorate. Italian rejection of Ethiopian protests that the Amharic version of article XVII \\nof the Treaty did not contain such a binding commitment led to war. The outcome of the war and  \\nthe Addis Ababa Peace treaty signed in October of 1896 do indeed lend strong support to such  \\nargument. There is, however, another dimension of the conflict which has not been given due  \\nattention. According to this interpretation, the objective of the war was to expel Italian rule from  \\nEthiopian territory (Negash, 1996a).\\nIntroductio\\nn 15\\naglia, 1958; Rossetti, 1910). However, having learned a severe lesson, the post- \\nAdwa Italian rulers of Eritrea as well as the leadership in Rome set out to keep \\nwhat they had managed to negotiate with the Ethiopians. As evidence of good-\\nwill, the Italian government sent to Eritrea as civilian governor Senator Ferdi- \\nnando Martini, one of the most competent statesmen of the period. Ferdinando \\nMartini was empowered to rule if he could or otherwise liquidate the colony in \\nthe best possible manner. The sale or transfer of the colony to the King of the Bel-\\ngians was under consideration (Rainero, 1971).\\nWith his prior knowledge of Eritrea Ferdinando Martini was, however, \\ndetermined to keep the colony for Italy, not so much for what the colony had to \\noffer, but largely for prestige (Martini, 1913). As civilian governor, he toned \\ndown the military dimension and was intelligent enough to realize that a great \\ndeal of work had to be done before colonies could begin to be of some profit to \\nthe mother country. During his decade-long governorship, 1897-1907, Martini \\nsucceeded admirably well in laying down the foundations of a colonial govern-\\nment, more or less along the lines used by Britain and France.\\nBy the time Ferdinando Martini left Eritrea (later to assume primary respon-\\nsibility as the Minister of Colonies), the Italian position in Eritrea was very \\nsecure indeed. Through the recognition of their inalienable rights to the land, \\nEritrean peasants were pacified. The law and order which Martini established \\nhad already begun to pay dividends. The new colony of Eritrea became a haven \\nfor fugitives, job-seekers, and slaves from the northern part of Ethiopia.1  As \\nearly as 1907 the policy of good neighbourliness and strict non-interference in \\nthe internal affairs of the areas adjoining Eritrea was beginning to distinguish \\nthe Italian colony from the adjoining areas administered by Ethiopian authori-\\nties.\\nAs the power of Emperor Minilik, owing to prolonged sickness, continued \\nto decline, the outlying territories were increasingly left to their own devices. In \\nthe meanwhile the Italian administered colony continued to gain from Pax Ital- \\nica. This was reflected in the increase of trade. Moreover, a new venue for \\nemployment had begun to attract surplus manpower in the form of recruitment \\nto the colonial army, a first contingent of which was sent to Somalia as early as \\n1906.\\nIt did not take many years for Governor Martini to assess the potential of the \\ncolony. Short of conquering Ethiopia, the Italians perceived that the best they \\ncould do was to use Eritrea as an outlet for Ethiopian products (Martini, 1913). \\nOn the eve of their occupation of Ethiopia in 1935, up to 25 per cent of Ethiopian \\nexports, as well as imports, were channelled through Eritrea (Santagata, 1935; \\nMisghena, 1988; Negash, 1987).\\nThe most important function of the colony remained as a supplier of colonial \\nsoldiers for Italian expansion elsewhere. It was, however, in Libya that Eritrea\\n1  ASMAI, AE, 557 (1909-12). This file contains more than a dozen letters from the chiefs of Tigrai  \\nasking for the return of their serfs and slaves who fled to Eritrea and to liberty.\\n16 Chapter On\\ne\\nand its inhabitants compensated Italy for the lather\\'s perseverance. Up to 4,000 \\nEritrean soldiers were permanently stationed in Libya between 1912 and 1932. \\nThe war in Libya, which dragged on until 1932, would have cost the Italian tax-\\npayers much more had it not been for the presence of loyal and efficient Eritrean \\nsoldiers. It is not an exaggeration to state that the Libyan occupation was made \\npossible by the continuous supply of fighting forces from the \\'first-born colony7  \\n(la colonia primogenita) at a cost which the Italian tax-payers and the state could \\neasily sustain.\\nThe continued presence of Eritrean soldiers in Libya had meant a rather \\nradical change in the relations between the colonial government and the Eri-\\ntrean population. The wanton expropriation of land was completely discon-\\ntinued. Moreover, more attention began to be paid to the reinstatement of cus-\\ntomary laws. During the 1920s, Eritrea settled peacefully and, we may even add, \\ncomfortably into its dual function: first, as a source of manpower for the Italian \\nwars of pacification in Libya, and second, as an outlet for a considerable portion \\nof Ethiopian imports and exports. Meanwhile, the modem sector of the \\neconomy began to establish itself with the continued assistance and even guid-\\nance of the Eritrean (colonial) government.\\nIn as far as employment, food supply and the availability of consumer goods \\nwere concerned, the 1920s and 1930s were indeed good years. The colonial army \\nand the steadily growing modem sector may have provided employment for up \\nto 15 per cent of the population. About five per cent of the labour force may have \\nbeen employed both in the colonial bureaucracy (clerks, interpreters, native \\njudges, etc) and in domestic service in Italian homes and establishments. The \\nfinancial flow from employers (the colonial government and the Italian commu-\\nnity) in turn created and stimulated the growth of the service sector which \\ncatered to the needs of the Eritrean community. Drought virtually ceased to be \\na catastrophic experience, since the colonial government could avert hunger \\ncrises through food imports (Negash, 1987:151-153; cf. Iliffe, 1983; O\\'Connor, \\n1991). There were no armed conflicts among the various ethnic groups, and no \\nsubversive activities were launched from the Ethiopian side of the border. By \\nthe end of the 1930s an entire generation of Eritreans had grown up under the \\npeace established by the Italian colonial system.\\nFrom the mid-1930s a combination of three factors further contributed \\ntowards the evolution of what may rightly be called the Eritrean consciousness. \\nThe first was the growing racist ideology which began to draw a distinction \\nbetween the Eritreans who were fortunate enough to be under the civilizing \\numbrella of Italy and the inhabitants of the Ethiopian empire (Pollera, 1935; \\nNegash, 1987). This policy, though devised to bolster Italian imperial or colonial \\nego, appeared to have trickled down to the Eritrean literati. The language of \\nmany Eritrean politicians in the 1940s betrays the pervasiveness of the colonial \\nracist ideology of the 1930s.1\\ni See Association of Eritrean Intellectuals, Asmara, 1949.\\nIntroductio\\nn 17\\nETHNIC MAP OF ERITREA\\nThe second factor was the economic boom that Italy\\'s war preparation against \\nEthiopia had created in Eritrea from 1932 onwards. The Italian population, \\nwhich in 1934 accounted for not more than 4,600 souls (including infants) soon \\nincreased to exceed 50,000 by the end of 1935.* The amount of money and mate-\\nrials poured into the colony and the shortage of Eritrean labour which ensued \\nwith this second Italian invasion distinguished the Eritreans even further from \\nthe inhabitants of the Ethiopian Empire.\\nFinally, the third factor was the Italo-Ethiopian War itself and the role the \\nEritreans were made to play, first in the actual conquering of Ethiopia and later \\nin its pacification. Unable to pacify an empire, at least ten times as large as \\nEritrea, the Italians resorted to exhorting the Eritreans to continue with the \\nadmirable job of pacification. The first colonial army in Ethiopia was made up \\nof slightly more than 50,000 Eritrean soldiers whose role was considered very \\ncrucial. In recognition of both the past and future contribution, Rome passed a \\ndecree in 1937 distinguishing the Eritreans from other subjects of the newly \\nfounded empire. The Eritreans were to be addressed as Eritreans and not as \\nnatives, as was the case with the rest. Furthermore, priority was to be given to \\nEritreans in certain categories of jobs and professions.\\nThe three factors mentioned above appear to have contributed greatly to the \\nrather widely spread belief in what one might call separate and distinct Eritrean\\n1  In 1938, the population in Asmara was made up of the following: 53,000 Italians and 43,000 Eri-\\ntreans according to Guida Dell\\'Africa Italiana, Torino, 1938.\\n18 Chapter On\\ne\\nidentity or consciousness. The main characteristic of this identity was based on \\nthe belief that the Eritreans and their country were more developed than the rest \\nof the empire.\\nOn the whole, Eritrean resistance to colonial rule was not of such a threaten-\\ning nature. However, as attempts to either Catholicize the Christian Eritreans or \\nto create a separate Orthodox Church for them proved futile, the Italians were \\nworried about eventual resistance. On the other hand, Italian policy of wooing \\nthe loyalty of Moslem communities had more success. Italian colonialism pro-\\ntected and encouraged the revival and consolidation of Islam. Since most of the \\nMoslem communities were earlier often raided and pillaged by Tigrean and \\nEthiopian rulers, the presence of Italian rule brought to an end such raiding and \\npillaging (Erlich, 1982; Negash, 1987:121-136). Throughout the colonial period, \\nthe Italians felt secure of the loyalty of their Moslem subjects while they con-\\ntinued to suspect that their Christian subjects might one day make common \\ncause with their co-religionists in Ethiopia.\\nItalian colonialism came to an end in April 1941. The Italians were defeated \\nby a joint Ethio-British force from the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan. Eritrea was the \\nfirst enemy territory to be freed. The British were to stay in power until 1952 \\nwhen Eritrea was federated to Ethiopia through a United Nations Resolution.\\nTHE LEGACY OF COLONIALISM: THE BRITISH M ILITARY \\nADMINISTRATION\\nBritish policy on the future of Eritrea was put into effect soon after Italy declared \\nwar on the allies in June 1940. Working closely with Emperor Haile Sellassie, \\nwhom the British flew from London to the Sudan, the British made it known \\nthat, if the Eritrean people so wished, they could be united with Ethiopia. As \\nearly as 1940, the British and the Americans were discussing the possibility of \\nhanding to Ethiopia the Abyssinian (Tigrean) parts of Eritrea. During the war, \\nhowever, the job of communicating with the Eritrean soldiers who were fighting \\nbeside the Italian army, was undertaken by a small intelligence group led by\\nG.L. Steer. The prime motive was to encourage desertion and the disintegration \\nof the Italian colonial army where the Eritrean contingents formed the main \\nfighting forces. In practical terms, British policy was limited to the printing and \\ndistribution of leaflets to Eritrea, inciting its inhabitants to join the forces of \\neither Emperor Haile Selassie or those of Great Britain. Although no great sig-\\nnificance can be attached to such subversive material, the exercise seemed to \\nhave achieved its desired objective. According to the account of G.L. Steer, thou-\\nsands of Eritreans deserted from the Italians between November 1940 and Feb-\\nruary 1941 (Steer, 1942).\\nFrom July 1940 until March 1941 about twenty numbers of a military bulletin \\nknown as Banderachin (Our Flag) were dropped by the Royal Air Force on \\nEritrea and other parts of Ethiopia. Out of all these pamphlets only two were \\ndirectly aimed at Eritrea. The first was a poster dominated by the seal of\\nIntroductio\\nn 19\\nEmperor Haile Sellassie with the full title of the Emperor neatly and beautifully \\nengraved. On the lower part was a slogan in Tigrinya that read \"Fight for your \\nking and your own flag\". The second, which contained the first Ethiopian Impe-\\nrial Decree, was issued in July 1940 and jointly written by the Emperor and his \\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, the Eritrean Lorenzo Taezaz. In this decree, \\ndescribed by Steer as most impressive, the Emperor and his minister addressed \\nthe major ethnic groups in Eritrea, exhorting them to join in the struggle at the \\nside of their Ethiopian brothers. Eritreans were further advised to refrain from \\nbeing tools in the hands of the Italians \"against your motherland of Ethiopia\".1\\nThe Ethio-British war against Italy that began in earnest in November 1940 \\ncame to an end, as far as Eritrea was concerned, in April 1941. The fifty year \\nItalian colonial rule was over. On behalf of the Allies and until the end of the \\nWar, the British assumed responsibility over Eritrea with a bare skeleton of staff \\nand with extremely tight financing. The subversive propaganda campaign \\ncarried out jointly by the British and Ethiopian authorities to undermine the \\nmorale of the Italian army, did indeed hasten the conclusion of the war in favour \\nof the Allies. Once in power, the British immediately turned their attention to \\nthe future of Eritrea. Meanwhile, acting on the propaganda material showered \\nover their heads, Eritrean leaders and elders formed Mahber Fikri Hager \\n(Assocaition for the Love of Country) in May 1941. The objective of this organi-\\nzation was immediate and unconditional union with Ethiopia. This organiza-\\ntion functioned as the spearhead of what the British described as the unionist or \\nirredentist movement.\\nThe idea of restructuring the colonial boundaries was widely discussed in \\nthe corridors of power even before the war against Italy was won. As early as \\n1942 two alternatives were discussed. These were: i) to hand over the Tigrean \\nparts to Ethiopia; and ii) to establish a greater Somalia (Louis, 1977:68). How-\\never, it was only in 1943 that the question of the future of Eritrea was seriously \\nconfronted. In a despatch from Asmara, the military administrator Stephen \\nLongrigg, who more than anyone else shaped British Eritrean policy, argued\\n1  In view of the importance of the decree, reference to which was repeatedly made by the UP and  \\nthe Emperor himself it is worthwhile to quote its relevant parts.\\nFirst decree of Emperor Haile Sellassie. \"Ethiopia Stretches her Hands unto God. Haile Selassie  \\nthe First, Elect of God, Emperor of Ethiopia.\\nBrave worriers of Ethiopia!\\nI know the merits of every one of you, and I speed to see your feat of arms. You the fighters, \\naccording to your bravery; you the old men and the men of God, according to the counsel that  \\nyou have given to your people; you the farmers traders and artisans, according as your work has  \\naided your Fatherland; you will all receive your recompense.\\nAnd you, the people of Hamassien, of Akelegousai (Akele Guzai), of Serae, of Beni Amer, of  \\nthe Habab and of Mensah, whether you are on this side or the other side of Mareb, join in the  \\nstruggle at the side of your Ethiopian brothers. Let none of you be a tool in the hands of the Ital-\\nians against your motherland of Ethiopia, or against our friends the English.\\nI know the prayers of your heart, which are mine also, and the prayers besides of all the people  \\nof Ethiopia. Your destiny is strictly bound with that of the rest of Ethiopia\".\\nFor a complete translation of the decree see Steer, 1942:231-232.\\n20 Chapter On\\ne\\npassionately that Eritrea be partitioned between Ethiopia and the Anglo-Egyp- \\ntian Sudan.1\\nWhy did Longrigg argue consistently for the partition of Eritrea? Was he \\nsolely motivated by British imperial interests which he represented, or were his \\nproposals based on his understanding of the history of the region, as well as on \\nthe unfolding political developments in Eritrea? British interests were no doubt \\nin the forefront; however, in so far as these are documented, they were ex-\\npressed in an extreme reluctance to use the taxpayers\\' money to administer an \\nenemy-occupied territory whose future was unknown (Pankhurst, 1952). It \\nappears to me fair to argue that for once Britain had no colonial ambition over \\nEritrea. However, as one of the Allies entrusted with the \"disposal\" of the \\ncolony, Britain had the obligation to make up her mind as how best to be \\nrelieved of her responsibilities after the end of the war.\\nAlthough detailed analysis of Longrigg\\'s proposals would lead us into \\nunwarranted digression, an outline of his views appears pertinent for clarifying \\nthe basis of British policy. His book (Longrigg, 1945), was written by the hand \\nof a person who combined a solid knowledge of history and anthropology. In \\nthis book, by far the best introductory text on the history of the region, Longrigg \\nargued that the Tigreans in Eritrea had always belonged to the Abyssinian po-\\nlitical state system which in turn was made up of the Tigreans and the Amhara \\n(Longrigg, 1945:169).\\nIn March 1944, Longrigg once again returned to the subject in a long des-\\npatch on problems of the administration of Eritrea. After listing a series of prob-\\nlems related to security and administration, Longrigg attempted to justify his \\nearlier position on partition on the grounds of the irredentist movement. In his \\ncapacity as administrator, he was in a good position to evaluate what he called \\n\"the problem of Ethiopian irredentism\". Describing it as a major problem facing \\nthe BMA, Longrigg wrote that in addition to the anti-white and anti-foreign sen-\\ntiment, the irredentist movement had certain specific elements of feeling or \\nopinion that easily strengthened the pro-Ethiopian sentiment. \"It goes without \\nsaying\", reasoned Longrigg, \"that the historical and cultural backgrounds of the \\nCoptic Eritreans are identical with those in Tigrai. Linguistically, the Tigrinya of \\nEritrea is identical with that of the Tigrai and is first cousin to Amharic. The \\nTigrai, therefore, form a solid bridge connecting Eritrea with the main body of \\nEthiopia\".2\\nAfter noting that the irredentist movement had thus far made little progress \\nin the countryside, Longrigg proceeded, in an exemplary manner, to describe \\nthe features of the movement in Asmara—the movement\\'s stronghold. In \\nAsmara, a number of urban notables were favourable to it on the grounds of \\npatriotic sentiment, of disappointment with the observed features of British \\nrule, and of anticipated advancement under the Emperor. According to Long-\\n1  WO 230/168. Longrigg to General Headquarters, Middle East Forces, Asmara, 12.10.43.\\n2 WO 230/168. Longrigg to MEF, 12.7.44.\\nIntroductio\\nn 21\\nrigg, the younger intelligentsia, on the other hand, were all irredentists. Besides \\nthe Coptic Eritreans (who formed part of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church) the \\nirredentist movement included Catholics and Protestants educated by the \\nSwedish Mission. To this list of who\\'s who in the irredentist movement might \\nalso be added a number of merchants.\\nThat the irredentist movement was bound to create serious problems for the \\nBMA as well as for the future of the colony appears to have been clearly per-\\nceived by Longrigg in the conclusion to his long despatch. He wrote:\\nThe Eritrean irredentist movement will almost certainly persist and grow— grow \\nperhaps from town to country, and from intrigue to violence. Unless its demands \\nor a main part of them are met at the peace conference, the movement will doubtless \\nconform to the usual pattern of local nationalist movements and constantly embar-\\nrass the European occupier of the territory, if such remains.1\\nThere could be little reason to doubt that the British were concerned about the \\nanti-white and anti-foreign tones of the irredentist movement. Longrigg \\nopposed strongly a private visit of the Ethiopian Crown Prince to Asmara on the \\ngrounds that such a visit would \"give considerable strength to the present irre-\\ndentist movement\". In 1943, partly out of the classical imperial logic of divide \\nand rule, and partly, I believe, due to his plausible notion about the viability of \\na Tigrai nation, Longrigg began suggesting to some Eritrean chiefs a new Eritrea \\ndifferent from that advocated by the irredentists. What exactly Longrigg inti-\\nmated to those Eritreans whom he cultivated as counterforces to the irredentist \\nmovement cannot be known, since such intimation was presumably made ver-\\nbally. However, from his own report on the impact of undercover work, it is \\napparent that Longrigg was engaged in spreading a political position that was \\nessentially novel in Ethiopian political history. Longrigg reported that, one of \\nthe several solutions that a considerable section seemed to prefer was \"the for-\\nmation of a united Tigrai state under at least temporary foreign guidance\".2  \\nLongrigg added that this view was increasingly held by leaders in Tigrai. The \\nleaders of this view continued Longrigg, \"would repudiate all connections with \\nthe Crown of Ethiopia, while pressing claims of the whole Tigrinya speaking \\nblock\". It is in this despatch that Longrigg provides us with a glimpse of the \\nworkings of British colonial officers.\\nLongrigg left Eritrea at the end of 1944. A few months later, he published his \\nShort History of Eritrea, a work most of which was presumably written in Eritrea \\nand drawing heavily on the expertise of Kennedy Trevaskis and S.F. Nadel.3  In \\na sweeping synthesis, that hitherto remains unrivalled, Longrigg argued on a \\nhistorical basis that the most populous and homogenous part of Eritrea had \\nbeen for many centuries an integral part of the Ethiopian state (Longrigg,\\n1  FO 371 /41531. Overseas Planning Committee: Plan for propaganda for Eritrea, 6.10.44.\\n2 WO 230/168. Longrigg to General Headquarters, Middle East Forces, Asmara, 12.7.43.\\n3 Kennedy Trevaskis was later to write Eritrea. A Colony in Transition, 1941-1952: 1960. S.F Nadel  \\nthe Anthropologist wrote on the Land Tenure systems in the Eritrean highlands and on the  \\nhistory of the Beni Amer of western Eritrea before he left for West Africa.\\n22 Chapter On\\ne\\n1945:169). Putting forward his personal opinion as to the future of Eritrea, Long- \\nrigg argued that the Moslem tribal areas adjoining the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, \\nbe included with the Sudan, while the central Christian highlands of Eritrea, \\nwith the port of Massawa and the Samhar and the Saho tribes, should form part \\nof a united Tigrai state or province, under the sovereignty of the Emperor (Long- \\nrigg, 1945:174-175).\\nIn London, the reports from Eritrea were primarily considered in the light of \\nthe administrative and security problems that might arise due to the growing \\nirredentist movement. The British government was concerned with the avoid-\\nance of serious recurrent expenditure. On the basis of Longrigg\\'s written and \\nverbal accounts, the Interdepartmental Overseas Planning Committee laid \\ndown a strategy to counteract the challenge posed by the irredentist movement. \\nThis strategy called for \"taking the initiative in our information services and \\nsearching for means to allow free discussion in the face of the propaganda in \\nfavour of union with Ethiopia\".1  In other words, London initiated a strategy for \\nan open encouragement of opinion which could neutralise the irredentist move-\\nment.\\nThe conclusion of the peace treaty with Italy in early 1947, triggered a \\nrenewed discussion on the future of the colony. According to the treaty, the \\nFour Powers undertook to jointly determine how to finally dispose of Italy\\'s ter-\\nritorial possessions after ascertaining the views and wishes of the population. \\nThe treaty also contained the provision that the Four Powers would send com-\\nmissions of enquiry in order to supply the Deputies of Foreign Ministers with \\nthe necessary data. Responding promptly to the stipulations of the treaty, the \\nBritish in Eritrea proceeded to define their position as well as to assist the Eri-\\ntrean people on how to express their views on the future of their country. More-\\nover, it was also incumbent on Britain as a caretaker power to provide the Four \\nPower Commission of Enquiry with the necessary background material that \\ncould facilitate the task of the commission.\\nBetween 1946 and November 1947, the BMA tried to put into practice the \\nadvice of Frank Stafford, based on his recent mission to Eritrea. A former finan-\\ncial advisor to the Imperial Ethiopian Government, Stafford argued that people \\nin Eritrea should be given every opportunity to learn of the alternatives that the \\nCommission of Enquiry would raise: namely, a choice between incorporation \\ninto the Ethiopian Empire and administration under a trusteeship. \"If the \\nadvantages of trusteeship were clearly explained\", argued Stafford, \"those \\nuncertain of the benefit of becoming Ethiopian subjects would welcome the \\nperiod of grace and the number of the Emperor\\'s adherents would diminish\".2\\nThe salient points of this detailed memorandum dealt firstly with the \\nmethod to be adopted to ascertain the wishes of the population, and, secondly, \\nwith the presentation of the alternatives, namely, incorporation into Ethiopia\\n1  FO 371 /41531.

In so far as Britain\\'s policy on the future of Eritrea was con-\\ncerned, the most relevant section of the memorandum dealt with the definition \\nof the alternatives.\\nIndependence for Eritrea was entirely ruled out, partly due to the BMA\\'s \\nassessment of the viability of the colony and partly due to the resilience of the \\nUnionist Party that campaigned for unconditional union with Ethiopia. It is \\nworth noting here that the British wished that the majority of the Eritrean \\npeople would opt for a trusteeship, since \"it would provide an attractive alter-\\nnative to outright absorption into Ethiopia, whose present regime and status of \\ndevelopment leave room for misgivings, particularly if the right to transfer to \\nEthiopia remains open during a period of trusteeship\".1  Britain would have \\nliked to see Eritrea under British or Four Power trusteeship rather than be incor-\\nporated into Ethiopia.\\nIn Eritrea, the chief administrator was laying the ground for the arrival of the \\nFour Power Commission of Enquiry by supervising the formation of political \\norganizations. The Unionist Party, reference to its existence had been made as \\nearly as 1943, was one of the first to be established in February 1947. The Union-\\nist Party which campaigned for unconditional union with Ethiopia, remained \\nthe single largest party throughout the 1947-50 period. The Moslem League, \\nnext largest party, emerged after the chief administrator made it clear to the \\nMoslem leaders that, \"unless they are prepared to think for themselves, the \\nplateau Christians will do the thinking for them\". The Liberal Progressive Party \\nthat campaigned for the creation of a united Tigrai—an organization allegedly \\ncreated by Stephen Longrigg—came into the open in early 1947. The New \\nEritrea Pro-Italy party was also formed in the early months of 1947 and advo-\\ncated the return of Italy in one form or another. By the time of the arrival of the \\nFour Power Commission of Enquiry in November 1947, four major political \\nparties were ready to make their views known on the future of their country. \\nFrom that time onwards, the future of the colony ceased to be a concern of \\nBritain only. The outcome was dependent on both internal and external factors, \\nwhere the role of Britain was by no means decisive.\\nThe Four Power Commission of Enquiry visited Eritrea between November \\n1947 and January 1948. It then proceeded to analyze the data it had gathered. As \\nwas expected, in those early years of intensive cold war no agreement was \\nreached on the future of Eritrea. Britain, contrary to the views elaborated by \\nStephen Longrigg and Stafford, proposed that Eritrea be given to Ethiopia. The \\nUnited States, France and the Soviet Union put forward proposals which were \\nunacceptable to Great Britain. In accordance with prior agreement, the question \\nof the \"disposal of Eritrea\" was duly submitted to the newly formed United \\nNations Organization.\\nBritish policy on the future of Eritrea was based on three considerations: \\nfirst, a consistent belief in the economic poverty of Eritrea; second, a recognition\\ni FO 371/63175. F.E. Stafford to FO, Asmara, 2.12.46.\\n24 Chapter On\\ne\\nof an irredentist movement that espoused union with Ethiopia; and third, an \\nappreciation of the \"legitimacy\" of Ethiopian claims to all of Eritrea, parts of it, \\nor at least an outlet to the sea. Although Britain, as the other three powers, \\naccepted the \"just claims\" of Ethiopia to an outlet to the sea, she by no means \\nfelt bound to hand over all the ports in Eritrea to Ethiopia.\\nOn the economic front, the decade of British administration was character-\\nized by a severe restructuring of the Eritrean economy. Up to 1945, the British \\nand the Americans used Italian equipment and skilled labour for war purposes, \\nas well as to provide for the needs of the Allies in the Middle East. Such an eco-\\nnomic boom created by the massive Italian participation continued up to the \\nend of the war. Soon after the end of the war, however, the Eritrean economy \\nexperienced a combination of recession and depression which hit the local \\nurban population hard. The war factories which had employed several thou-\\nsand were closed down. The Italians began to be repatriated. Many of the small \\nmanufacturing plants which were established between 1936 and 1945 were \\nforced out of business due to stiff competition from plants in Europe and the \\nMiddle East. Moreover, unlike the Italians, the British were determined to \\nachieve a balanced budget. The cumbersome and sophisticated bureaucracy \\ncreated by the Italians was soon dismantled with the inevitable consequences on \\nemployment and cash flow. The social strains created by the shortage of money, \\nincreasing cost of living and growing unemployment were made to bite even \\nmore by the lifting of the ban against political activities. For the first time in the \\nhistory of Eritrea, the people were not only allowed but even encouraged to \\nestablish appropriate political organizations. The implications were far reach-\\ning. Although the Italian and British presence in Eritrea cannot be satisfactorily \\ncompared, such a comparison was, nonetheless, made by the common man in \\nAsmara. In the late 1960s, the story was told in more or less the following \\nmanner. During the Italian period the rule was: eat but do not talk. The British \\nchanged the rule to: talk but do not eat. In the 1960s a third experience was \\nadded, namely the Ethiopian experience where the rule was: do not eat and do \\nnot talk.\\nSTATE OF RESEARCH AND ORGANIZATION OF THE STUDY \\nState of research\\nResearch on the 1941-62 period, by and large, is dominated by Kennedy Tre- \\nvaskis and by those who by persuasion worked along the broad interpretative \\nlines developed by the Eritrean nationalist forces. The war for the independence \\nof Eritrea, first waged by the Eritrean Liberation Front (ELF) and later continued \\nto victory by the Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF), had to a great extent \\ndetermined the priorities of research. In broad terms the Eritrean nationalist \\norganizations argued that the majority of the Eritrean people wished for inde-\\npendence and that the federal arrangement was imposed upon them by the\\nIntroductio\\nn 25\\nUnited Nations. The dismantling of this federation by the Ethiopian govern-\\nment, continued the argument, was further evidence of the Eritrean desire for \\nindependence. The unilateral abolition of the federation by Ethiopia in effect \\nturned Eritrea into a colony and therefore the relationship into that of a colonial \\none.\\nFrom the mid-1970s onward, the EPLF chose to concentrate on the illegality \\nof the UN-decision uniting Eritrea with Ethiopia and on the right to self-deter-\\nmination, as a direct remedy to as well as a consequence of the mistake commit-\\nted by the UN. The 1941-62 period was referred to, if at all, very selectively.\\nThere is also another reason for the paucity of research on the 1941-62 \\nperiod. Archival sources for the period, which were inaccessible in Ethiopia, \\nwere also inaccessible in Britain, due to the thirty year rule. Although the 1941- \\n52 period could be studied from the mid-1980s, the entire coverage of the feder-\\nation period, 1952-62 had to wait until the early 1990s. However, from the mid- \\n1980s onwards, it was possible, and certainly profitable to study the first half of \\nthe life of the federation. Only few took the opportunity to check the archival \\nrecords and many of them did so in a very haphazard manner.\\nThe bulk of the literature on Eritrean history during the 1941-52 period is \\nexclusively based on the pioneering study of G.K.N. Trevaskis whose privileged \\nposition as colonial officer from 1943-50 gave him exaggerated authority. His \\nbook with the modest title of Eritrea: A Colony in Transition, 1941-52, was pub-\\nlished in 1960. Trevaskis\\' book is well-written and quite informative and will \\nremain a good source, albeit apologetic and obviously pro-British, on the record \\nof the British Military Administration (BMA) in Eritrea (Rubenson, 1962:520- \\n530).\\nThe major influence of Trevaskis\\' book lies, however, in its treatment of the \\nEritrean Unionist Party (UP). In the following paragraphs, I shall first outline \\nthe account of Trevaskis as regards the evolution of Ethiopian nationalism \\namong the Eritreans during the decade of the 1940s. Then I shall briefly sketch \\nthe wide discrepancies between Trevaskis\\' account and that which can be recon-\\nstructed from the British colonial archival records.\\nIn his chapter on the growth of political consciousness, Trevaskis outlines \\nthe evolution of the Eritrean political organization which advocated uncondi-\\ntional union with Ethiopia. By way of introduction he sketches Ethiopia\\'s claim \\nto Eritrea on historical, strategic and economic grounds. He even comments on \\nthe propaganda leaflets which were scattered from the air by the British Air \\nForce, and promised the Eritreans freedom under the sovereignty of the Ethio-\\npian emperor (Trevaskis, 1960:58).\\nHe wrote that during the Italian colonial period the Tigreans in Eritrea had \\nbeen surprisingly indifferent to their historical links with Ethiopia. When the \\nItalians invaded Ethiopia in 1935, they had received the most loyal and whole-\\nhearted Eritrean cooperation (Trevaskis, 1960:59). The Ethiopians, Trevaskis \\ncontinues his reconstruction, were profoundly shocked to find out that the \\nBritish treated Eritrea as \"legally Italian territory\". Italian officials were allowed\\n26 Chapter One\\nto\\n retain their positions, and there was a widespread belief among the Italian \\ncommunity that Italian authority would return to Eritrea no matter what the \\noutcome of the war (Trevaskis, 1960:59). With this background, Trevaskis \\napproached the evolution of irredentism in Eritrea as a phenomenon that was \\nwholly inspired from outside of Eritrea. He wrote:\\nIf they were not to lose their case by default, the Ethiopians had to arouse some Eri-\\ntrean support. To this end they first turned to the Coptic Church. The Church had  \\nalways been the custodian of Abyssinian tradition and could consequently be  \\nexpected to exercise an exceptional influence amongst the Abyssinians in Eritrea\\nand Ethiopia and, in its own interests, to work for their political union .....By 1942\\nevery priest had become a propagandist in the Ethiopian cause, every village had  \\nbecome a centre of Ethiopian nationalism, and popular religious feast days ... had  \\nbecome occasions for open displays of Ethiopian patriotism. (Trevaskis, 1960:59-60)\\nSuch a description is, I maintain, far from correct. The Tigreans in Eritrea were \\nfar from indifferent to their historical links with Ethiopia. The Italians had failed \\nto create loyal subjects of the Christian Eritreans. In fact one of the main factors \\nwhich pushed Italy to invade Ethiopia was to preempt the growth of Ethiopian \\nnationalism in Eritrea (Negash, 1987:127-131). Not even during the invasion of \\nEthiopia, 1935-36, did the Italians fully succeed in relying on their colonial \\narmy. Up to 20 per cent of the Italian colonial army had defected to the Ethio-\\npian opposition forces and continued to engage Italian forces until Italy was \\nfinally defeated in 1941 (Negash, 1986:55-72).\\nTrevaskis\\' reconstruction of the Ethiopian situation is equally based on an \\ninadequate understanding of Ethiopian history. Ethiopia was liberated from the \\nbrief but intensive Italian colonial rule in May 1941. During the following three \\nyears the Ethiopian government had other more important issues to deal with. \\nThe Second World War had not yet ended, and the Ethiopians had accepted the \\ndecision of the Allies that some parts of Ethiopia remain in British possession. \\nMoreover, the British had a tight control over Ethiopian public finance. As \\nregards Eritrea, the British had neither the mandate nor the juridical obligation \\nto hand over Eritrea to Ethiopia. Italian occupation of Eritrea was of a long \\nstanding, whereas Rome\\'s occupation of Ethiopia was part of the diplomacy of \\nthe 1930s which eventually led to the Second World War.\\nThe government of Emperor Haile Selassie had neither the funds nor the \\nhuman expertise to exercise such influence over the Church. Aware of the close \\nlinks between the Church and Ethiopian nationalism, the Italians had made \\ngreat efforts to weaken irredentist sentiments. Initially they tried to Catholicize \\nthe Coptic Christians with dismal results. Later on they attempted to separate \\nthe Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Eritrea from the Ethiopian Church by putting \\nthe former directly under the Patriarchate in Alexandria. From 1930 until the \\nItalian occupation of Ethiopia, the Eritrean Orthodox Church was officially \\noutside the spiritual jurisdiction of the Ethiopian Church. However, once the \\nItalians gained control over Ethiopia, they undid their 1930 achievement by \\nassimilating not only the church structure, but also the colony of Eritrea, into\\nIntroductio\\nn 27\\ntheir Ethiopian Empire. Between 1936 and 1941, Eritrea constituted a province \\nof the Italian East African Empire with its capital in Addis Ababa (Negash, \\n1987:127-129). The Italians affirmed the hegemony of the Ethiopian Church \\nover all the orthodox churches of the empire (including Eritrea). Unwittingly \\nthe Italians did a memorable service to Ethiopia by declaring the Ethiopian \\nOrthodox Church autocephalous thus breaking the sixteen hundred year long \\ndependence of the Ethiopian church on Egypt (Negash, 129-130).\\nThe Ethiopian Orthodox Church in Eritrea did not have to wait for mobiliza-\\ntion by the Ethiopian state for its union with Ethiopia, since it had long been part \\nof the Ethiopian establishment. Neither were the Eritreans as passive and docile \\nas Trevaskis imagined them to be. Though not seriously bothered by Eritrean \\nresistance, the Italians were, nevertheless, aware of the historical and cultural \\nlinks between the Christian Eritreans and their co-religionists in the rest of \\nEthiopia. It appears that Trevaskis found it virtually impossible to understand \\nhow the Eritreans \"who were loyal to the Italians\" could at the earliest opportu-\\nnity rise up against the dying Italian rule and challenge Pax Britannica.\\nThe activities of the \"Coptic Church\", continues Trevaskis, prepared the way \\nfor the development of an organized political movement, which was brought \\nabout in 1942 by Ethiopian intervention. Ethiopia managed to achieve such a \\nbasis of support, presumably by a procession of young Ethiopian officials who \\nwere despatched to Asmara and made contact with the Eritrean intelligentsia. \\n\"In the event\", Trevaskis concludes his account, \"a society known as the Mahber \\nFikri Hager or Assocaition for love of country, and dedicated to uniting Eritrea \\nwith Ethiopia, came into being during 1942\" (Trevaskis, 1960:60). The Mahber \\nFikri Hager (officially converted to a political party with the name of the Union-\\nist Party in early 1947) was established in 1941 and not as Trevaskis stated in\\n1942.1  It was formed the same day as the exiled Emperor Haile Sellassie made \\nhis triumphal entry into Addis Ababa on May 5,1941. It has to be clearly stated \\nthat by 1942 the Ethiopian government hardly existed. It was run to a large \\nextent by Great Britain (Marcus, 1983:8-20; Spencer, 1983). How was it that the \\nEritreans were so quick to get organized and demand immediate and uncondi-\\ntional union with Ethiopia? Perhaps unwittingly the British had greatly contrib-\\nuted to the articulation of Eritrean demands. Between July 1940 and April 1941, \\nthe British and the small Ethiopian contingent were busy encouraging Eritreans \\nto betray their Italian rulers and fight for their emperor and country.\\nMost of the background to and the success of the joint British and Ethiopian \\nintelligence operation have been recorded by one of its architects (Steer, 1942). \\nThe main thrust of the campaign was to entice Eritrean soldiers away from the \\nItalians.\\nThe British, as Trevaskis quite rightly pointed out, did not feel committed to \\nassist either the Eritreans or the Ethiopian state in uniting Eritrea with Ethiopia.\\n1  On the early history of the Mahber Fikri Hager, see EWN no. 227 (9.1.47) Ethiopia, no. 103  \\n(17.4.49).\\n28 Chapter One\\nH\\nowever, neither Trevaskis nor the British Military Administration were pre-\\npared to consider the impact of their war propaganda on the Eritreans. Instead, \\nTrevaskis and his colleagues chose to interpret the existence of the Unionist \\nParty as a challenge to their rule.\\nThe earliest mention of the Unionist movement, in the British archives, was \\nin 1943. By this time the irredentist movement was predominant in the urban \\nareas and was mainly made up of \"young men of the educated class, supported \\nby the wealthy merchants and also by certain prominent religious leaders above \\nall the two bishops of the Coptic Christians and the Catholics of the Ethiopian \\nrite\" (Negash, 1987).\\nThe chiefs were reluctant to support the \"nationalists\", continued Trevaskis, \\nlest they displeased the British and they would have preferred to remain safely \\non the fence until they knew on which side to alight had it not been for the \\n\"sudden emergence\" of an opposition movement to the nationalists during\\n1943.1  The activists of the Mahber Fikri Hager, by now described as the nation-\\nalists, were suspicious of British support to the Separatist Movement and had \\nby the end of 1943, according to Trevaskis, begun to canvas for signatures to a \\npopular petition demanding immediate union with Ethiopia (Trevaskis, \\n1960:64). This opposition movement, which came to be known as the Separatist \\nMovement (and later as the Liberal Progressive Party), had no clear goal but was \\nknown to be anti-Ethiopian and pro-British (Trevaskis, 1960:62). It was natural, \\nargued Trevaskis, that the British officers should feel better disposed towards \\nthose who professed respect for them than towards those who were known to \\nabuse them. Such a provocative attitude was caused by the quite overt British \\nsupport of the Separatist movement and by a promise made by the British mili-\\ntary administrator that Eritrean wishes would be taken into account when the \\ntime came for the future of the country to be decided (Trevaskis, 1960:64).\\nThe archival sources confirm the suspicions of the Unionist Movement. The \\nSeparatist Movement did not as Trevaskis alleges suddenly emerge. The idea \\nfor such a movement was suggested to some Eritrean chiefs by Stephen Long- \\nrigg, the chief administrator of Eritrea. Although the foundation of the Separat-\\nist Movement was instigated by the British and enjoyed their full support, it \\nremained confined to a few villages in the southern part of the highlands.\\nIn an atmosphere of rumour and suspicion tension mounted, which made \\nthe British flex their muscles. The Eritrean police strike in February 1944, where \\nthe strikers demanded the removal of Italian police, the annulment of Italian \\nlaws, and the dismissal of Italian judges, created an opportunity for the BMA to \\ndismiss a large number of active Nationalists in the police, thus breaking the \\nstrike at once and giving a severe setback to the Nationalist Movement (Tre-\\nvaskis, 1960:65). Suppressed in Eritrea, the Nationalist cause, continued Tre-\\n1  The separatist movement did not emerge suddenly. It was instigated by Stephen Longrigg as part  \\nof his plans to weaken the position of the Nationalists. For a more detailed discussion on the  \\norigins of the Separatist Party, see Chapter Two.\\nIntroductio\\nn 29\\nvaskis, was taken up in Ethiopia by the Ethiopia-Hamasien Society, an organi-\\nzation of supposedly Eritrean residents in Ethiopia whose declared objective \\nwas the union of Eritrea with Ethiopia. According to Trevaskis, this organiza-\\ntion was known to be financed and directed by the Ethiopian government. It is \\nprobable that the British may have caused the Unionist movement a severe set-\\nback, by showing favour to the Separatist movement and by the draconian mea-\\nsures taken against the police strike. But the UP was far from dead.\\nWhen the question of the disposal of Eritrea was first discussed in the \\nautumn of 1945 at the London Conference, Ethiopian claims to Eritrea were not \\nviewed with any sympathy. Not only were Ethiopian claims disregarded in the \\npeace talks preceding the formation of the United Nations, such claims were \\nalso seen with great suspicion at the United Nations where the issue was finally \\nresolved. The position of Ethiopia vis a vis Italy on Eritrea is a subject studied \\nwith great eloquence by Amare Tekle in a dissertation which unfortunately \\nremains unpublished (Tekle, 1964). Virtual disregard of Ethiopian claims, wrote \\nTrevaskis, \"led to the dismay of the Nationalists and the jubilation of the Sepa-\\nratists who drew up a number of petitions addressed to the Foreign Ministers of \\nthe Allied Powers in which they demanded British trusteeship\" (Trevaskis, \\n1960:66).\\nBy the beginning of 1946, Trevaskis wrote that the Nationalists had to win \\ninternational sympathy somehow if they were not to lose their case by default. \\nThe decisive step was, according to Trevaskis, taken by the Ethiopian govern-\\nment in appointing Colonel Negga Haile Selassie, as Ethiopian Liaison Officer \\nwith the evident intention of reviving the Nationalist Movement. While Colonel \\nNegga presumably was settling into his job, Trevaskis wrote that the first part \\nof 1946 witnessed an exceptionally bitter campaign against Arabs and Italians, \\ncarried out by the Nationalist Movement. These anti-Italian and anti-Arab cam-\\npaigns were supported by a number of nationalist demonstrations and proces-\\nsions.\\nWhen appointed Colonel Negga Haile Selassie was a young man in his \\ntwenties. He was appointed as a consular liaison officer and had a junior rank \\nin the Ethiopian service.1  As an Ethiopian he was most probably looked up to \\nby the Eritrean unionists. As an Ethiopian too, he supported, sympathised with \\nand advocated the Unionist cause. Throughout the 1940s, the Ethiopian liaison \\noffice was staffed by two people, namely, Negga Haile Selassie and his secre-\\ntary. How could two individuals revive a moribund movement, when the \\nBritish with the entire power apparatus in their hands had only succeeded in \\ncreating a tiny Separatist Movement? How could Colonel Negga and his secre-\\ntary breathe life into a severely crushed movement when the Italian community \\nwith full support from Rome was virtually2 unable to soften the anti-Italian feel-\\n1  In a conversation Negga Haile Selassie intimated to me that whatever he knew of Ethiopian  \\nhistory he learned it in Eritrea from the leaders of the Unionist Party.\\n2 For further discussion and reconstruction of Italian political activities during the 1945-50 period,  \\nsee Chapter Two.\\n30 Chapter On\\ne\\nings in Eritrea? The archival sources do not provide any proof that the Ethiopian \\nliaison officer was doing the job of the Unionist Movement.1\\nIn the summer of 1946, Trevaskis continues, the British decided to put an end \\nto the nationalist demonstrations. During one of the unauthorized demonstra-\\ntions, the British colonial soldiers from the Sudan who had been stationed in \\nEritrea since 1941 intervened, thus breaking the demonstration and arresting a \\nnumber of ringleaders. However, within an hour rioting broke out; a mob \\ninvaded the police station and freed the ringleaders. The British decision to re-\\narrest the ringleaders caused even more serious rioting. The Sudanese Defence \\nForce was called into action and, according to Trevaskis \"a few rounds were \\nfired, four of the mob were killed, and order was immediately restored\". The \\nSudanese Defence Force was made up of Sudanese soldiers who were brought \\nto Eritrea during the Anglo-Italian campaign and were stationed in Eritrea to \\nenable the British Military Administration to \"keep law and order\" (Trevaskis, \\n1960:67-68). Trevaskis did not deem it necessary to discuss whether the demon-\\nstrations were of a nature which called for provocative intervention. Both the \\nUnionist Party and the Pro-Ethiopian weekly New Times and Ethiopia News  \\nargued strongly that the demonstration was a peaceful one. The British decision \\nto break up the assembly and arrest the ringleaders in the middle of the proces-\\nsion was indeed a deliberate provocation (NTEN, August, 1946).\\nWhat Trevaskis generally described as \"nationalist demonstrations\" had in \\nreality their origins in more concrete economic issues. The Eritrean Christians \\nexperienced daily the rising cost of living and dwindling job opportunities, \\nwhile the Italians not only dominated the modem sector of the economy but \\nwere also heavily represented in the administration of the country. Moreover, \\nArab merchants and the Eritrean Moslem trading community known as Jeberti \\nwere seen as exploiting the little surplus that the peasantry and the urban \\nworkers managed to scrape together. In the rural areas, it was widely known \\nthat peasants sold their crops to Eritrean Moslem and Arab merchants many \\nmonths before the crops were harvested. So, the demonstrations were not \\nsimply occasions for affirming the commitment of the Unionist Party to an \\nunconditional and speedy union with Ethiopia; the demonstrations called for \\nthe Eritreanization of the administration and of the economy.\\nThe incident of July 1946, where the Sudanese Defence Force killed four of \\nthe rioting mob revived deep-seated prejudices and ill-feeling between \\nSudanese and Abyssinians. Exactly a month later a Sudanese soldier was stoned \\nto death by a mob, probably as revenge for the incident of the previous month. \\nA few hours later about 70 soldiers from the Sudanese Defence Force sur-\\nrounded the native part of the city killing 46 people and wounding more than \\n60. The British were held responsible for the murderous spree of their colonial\\n1  The conspiratorial thesis of Trevaskis can be further disproved by citing what happened fifty  \\nyears later. In the 1980s, the Ethiopian government had an army of ca. 100,000 stationed in Eritrea  \\nin an attempt to keep it within the Ethiopian state. By then the Ethiopian government had alien-\\nated the majority of the Eritrean people.\\nIntroductio\\nn 31\\nsoldiers and they did not work very hard to dispel the wide spread suspicion \\nand mistrust among the Christian Eritreans. The wave of indignation following \\nthe Asmara incident writes Trevaskis, swelled the Nationalist camp. After that \\nincident the majority of the Christian Eritreans viewed alien European rule with \\nbitter disillusionment and saw no other solution to their problems than Eritrea\\'s \\nunion with Ethiopia (Trevaskis, 1960:68).\\nAs can be seen from Trevaskis\\' own reconstruction, it was hardly the young \\nEthiopian liaison officer Negga Haile Selassie who revived and welded together \\nthe Unionist movement. By unleashing a reign of terror, it was the British them-\\nselves who provided the Unionist movement with the ammunition it required \\nto consolidate its hold over the Christian population.\\nTrevaskis condemns the Mahber Fikri Hager (The Unionist Party) as an \\nEthiopian creation. Why was he not able to see it as, by and large, an Eritrean \\norganization? Three factors appear to have influenced Trevaskis in shaping his \\npoints of departure. The first one was the reluctance of the BMA officers in \\nEritrea to come to terms with an anti-colonialist movement in the form of the \\nUP. In the early 1940s it was commonly believed that British rule in Africa \\nwould endure for many decades, if not centuries. The winds of change that \\nbegan to blow soon after the independence of India in 1947 were in the case of \\nAfrica grudgingly acknowledged only in the middle of the 1950s. Therefore, it \\nwas much easier for a number of BMA officers, including Trevaskis, to look \\nupon these as Ethiopian subversive activities rather than as the autonomous \\naction of the UP in Eritrea. The UP was far ahead of its time.\\nThe British who were conducting a war and who were also beginning to \\nevolve the restructuring of the map of Africa along ethnic lines were not pleased \\nwith this political cum cultural movement. The colonial ethos, after all, \\nremained intact. So, no wonder that the British were not well disposed towards \\nthe Unionist Party. \"Among some British\", wrote Trevaskis, \"there was un-\\ndoubted resentment at the challenge to their authority (British power) implicit \\nin Ethiopian pretensions and many British officers found it difficult to conceal \\ntheir dislike of the bitter and touchy young men in the Mahber Fikri Hager\" \\n[Unionist Partyl (Trevaskis, 1960:61).\\nThe second factor was most likely related to the policies the BMA pursued \\nin the formation of public opinion in Eritrea. It was, for instance, the British who \\nprovided the initial impetus in 1943 for the formation of the Separatist move-\\nment that later emerged as the Liberal Progressive Party (LPP). It was also the \\nBritish who twisted the arms of the Moslem leaders in Eritrea to form the \\nMoslem League (ML) towards the end of 1946. Trevaskis, who during this \\nperiod was in Eritrea and who no doubt was deeply involved in the formation \\nof British policy in Eritrea, must have found it rather natural to perceive the \\nEthiopian state as playing a game similar to that of the BMA. Even if we were to \\nconcede that the Ethiopian government did indeed play a similar game, it \\nwould have required much more manpower and funds at its disposal. These \\nwere in short supply. Moreover, the available research on Ethiopian foreign\\n32 Chapter On\\ne\\npolicy of the period suggests that Ethiopia\\'s main expectation was an outlet to \\nthe sea (Spencer, 1983; Tekle, 1964; Marcus, 1983).\\nThe third factor may well have been Trevaskis\\' profound knowledge of the \\nrole of the Ethiopian state in undermining the federal and autonomous status of \\nEritrea, facts widely known in the period when he was finalizing his book \\ntoward the end of 1958. There are strong reasons to believe that Trevaskis was \\nreading history backwards, sometimes an irresistible temptation not only in the \\nhands of amateurs but also among those trained in the historian\\'s craft.\\nOne of the most pervasive impacts of the Trevaskian treatment of the UP has \\nbeen that later historians have continued to treat the UP in the same fashion. \\nEven historians who ought to be aware of the biases of colonial writers appear \\nto have fallen victim to the eloquent, albeit mistaken, reconstruction of Tre-\\nvaskis. The most important of these authors are discussed in the chapter dealing \\nwith Eritrean political parties. However the greatest impact of Trevaskis has \\nbeen on the Eritrean Liberation Fronts which were determined to re-write his-\\ntory. Like other nationalist movements elsewhere, the Eritrean organizations \\nfighting for the establishment of an independent state continued to treat the \\nUnionist Party as a movement which was hardly related to Eritrean history.1  \\nTrevaskis\\' description of the Unionist Party suited perfectly the objectives of \\nthose Eritreans who either rejected the federation or regretted it afterwards.\\nAn examination of the British colonial sources, the local Eritrean sources, as \\nwell as the Ethiopian position on the future of Eritrea, will, I believe, enable us \\nto redress the shortcomings of the Trevaskian account. It will also, I hope, do \\nsome justice to the Unionist Party, an organization which single-handedly \\nplayed a crucial role in the history of Eritrea.\\nThe academic literature on the federation period, 1952-62, though largely \\nbased on the political background sketched by Trevaskis shows, with few \\nexceptions, glaring errors related to chronology and the unfolding of events. \\nThis is indeed unfortunate. Continuing a reconstruction of the history of the Eri-\\ntrean armed insurrection against Ethiopia, Dr Tseggai wrote: \"The new Eritrean \\ngovernment—a democratically elected government with a democratic constitu-\\ntion—would not coexist with Ethiopia\\'s absolutist and archaic monarchy. With \\nits labour unions and independent political parties, Eritrea was anathema to the \\nEthiopian entity\" (Tseggai, 1988:74). With such a preamble, the 1952-62 period \\nis treated with great ease as that of the dismantling of the Eritrean government \\napparatus by Ethiopia. The suppression of labour unions, and political parties, \\nthe introduction of the official language of Ethiopia, and the incursions into \\nfreedom of speech and assembly are all cited as the steps allegedly taken by the \\nEthiopian government between 1952 and 1962. These have all happened. But the \\nquestion which writers like Tseggai appear keen to avoid was the role of the Eri-\\n1  While Trevaskis\\' book was translated into Arabic by Othman Saleh Sabby, (leader of ELF), the  \\nessential points of the book have been used by the EPLF (1975) in its primers for political educa-\\ntion.\\nIntroductio\\nn 33\\ntrean government in the process of the dismantling of the federation. Tseggai \\nfurther wrote: \"A whole country was illegally reduced to a mere province of a \\nneighbouring country, and the Eritreans were put under the rule of yet another \\noccupier, this time a neighbouring black African power\" (Tseggai, 1988:75). A \\nsimple reading of the Eritrean constitution and a cursory investigation of the \\nfunctioning of the Eritrean government make it abundantly clear that the \\nmembers of the Eritrean government were not as helpless as we are made to \\nbelieve. This study shows that the Eritrean government on its own initiative dis-\\nmantled the federation.\\nA far more flagrant example of the impact of Trevaskis as well as that of the \\nknowledge derived from the Eritrean nationalist fronts is the study of Ogbazghi \\nYohannes (1991) which depicts the process of the termination of the federation \\nas exclusively an act of the Ethiopian government. His account (described as the \\nbest documented) is so replete with factual and interpretative errors that it is \\nvirtually impossible within this context to point out its main weaknesses. \\nNeither is the more recent study by Ruth Iyob different from this depiction of \\nthe Unionist Party as a supine instrument of the Ethiopian state (Ogbazghi, \\n1991; Iyob, 1995:82-107). This study shows that scholars like Tseggai, Iyob, and \\nYohannes would certainly have refrained from making such wild statements, if \\nthey had taken the trouble to look into the record of the Eritrean government.\\nAnother author who has followed Trevaskis is John Markakis. In his major \\nstudy (1987) Markakis attempted to steer a middle course, while at the same \\ntime restating the basic assumptions of Trevaskis. His wide knowledge and \\nexperience of Ethiopian society enabled him to explain satisfactorily the foun-\\ndations of pro-Ethiopian ideology, as well as the politics of the most important \\nEritrean nationalist organization (The Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front). Yet \\nhis failure or reticence to consult the rich archival documentation on the 1941- \\n62 period seriously weakened the value of his efforts. The same goes for David \\nPool, Richard Sherman, Haggai Erlich and many others as well. In an article en-\\ntitled \"Eritrean Nationalism\", Pool takes for granted Trevaskis\\' interpretation as \\nregards the 1940s and that of the liberation fronts for the 1950s, while Keller \\nbased his argument solely on biased pro-nationalist sources (Markakis, 1987; \\nPool, 1983:175-193; Keller, 1990:95-114; Erlich, 1981:171-182).\\nAnother scholar who has studied the history of the federation is the prolific \\nBereket Habte Sellassie, not as a subject on its own but as part of a much wider \\nfield involving the United Nations. An Eritrean nationalist a priori, Habte \\nSellassie was neither interested in explaining the process nor in contextualising \\nhis bold statements. As a spokesman of the Eritrean Nationalist Movement, \\nHabte Sellassie was too inclined to read history backwards. Fully satisfied by \\nthe biased statements of Trevaskis, he readily blamed the Ethiopian government \\nfor the dissolution of the federation. His main line of argument is that the \\nmarriage of democratic ideas and institutions (which presumably prevailed in \\nEritrea) to an imperial and feudal power was a fatal combination. Here Habte \\nSellassie took for granted that the Eritrean leaders (the executive and the legis-\\n34 Chapter One\\nlativ\\ne organs) were capable and willing to implement the constitution which \\nwas drafted for them by the United Nations. This study shows that long before \\nthe Eritrean constitution was approved by the Ethiopians, the Eritreans them-\\nselves had violated it. Further explaining the inevitable dissolution of the \\nfederation, Habte Selassie dwelt, firstly on the \"inordinate ambition of Emperor \\nHaile Sellassie to incorporate Eritrea as an integral part of his feudal empire\". \\nSecondly, he mentioned, \"the fear and uncertainty of a feudal regime harnessed \\nto a modern bourgeois democratic government\" (Habte Selassie, 1989:42).\\nThis study shows that Bereket Habte Sellassie had hardly any knowledge of \\nthe composition and functioning of the Eritrean government which came into \\nexistence in 1952. It was far from being modern, democratic or bourgeoise. \\nEmperor Haile Sellassie did not have an inordinate ambition to incorporate \\nEritrea. Already in the mid 1960s Dr. Amare Tekle\\'s study on the creation of the \\nEthio-Eritrean Federation showed clearly that Ethiopia\\'s claims had few sup-\\nporters and that it stood no chance against the Vatican-Mecca-Latin American \\nAxis at the United Nations (Tekle, 1964).\\nNot all authors are such victims of the Trevaskian legacy as those cited \\nabove. Lloyd Ellingson\\'s thesis on Eritrea substantially refutes the Trevaskian \\nlegacy by its recognition of the role of Eritrean actors during the 1941-52 period \\n(Ellingson, 1986). In particular, Ellingson discussed the role played by the Italian \\ncommunity and the extent to which this provoked Eritrean organizations into \\naction. Although Ellingson, as Trevaskis before him, exaggerated the role of the \\nEthiopian government, he, nonetheless, drew the conclusion that the Unionist \\nParty had considerable autonomy and functioned with a clear objective \\n(Ellingson, 1986:41-54). Ellingson completed his thesis in 1986 and was thus \\nable to look into the archival material until the end of 1954 deposited at the \\nPublic Record Office (PRO).\\nAn author who in my opinion has a clear grasp of the role of the Unionist \\nParty is Thoma Killion. In his study, Killion had no problem in arguing that the \\nfederal state of Eritrea was run by the Unionist Party, working closely with the \\nEthiopian government. For Killion, the government in Eritrea was Unionist/ \\nEthiopian. By this he meant that whereas the actual running of the business of \\nthe government was carried out by the former members of the Unionist Party, \\nEthiopian presence and power was felt in the areas which fell under its domain, \\nnamely, foreign and interstate trade, railways and communications, defence \\nand foreign policy (Killion, 1985).\\nOrganization of the study\\nThis study is introduced by a long chapter on the Unionist Party and its relations \\nwith the other parties on the eve of the UN resolution of 1950. The Unionist \\nParty (UP) campaigned for unconditional union between Eritrea and Ethiopia. \\nUnfairly treated by Trevaskis, the Unionist Party was even more relegated to the \\nsidelines by the Eritrean nationalist fronts as well as writers. In my opinion\\nIntroductio\\nn 35\\ndespite the archival documentation leaving a great deal to be desired, and the \\ndeplorable fact that very few memoirs have been left behind, the available \\nsources are sufficient to undertake a reconstruction of the Unionist Party and its \\nrole in the destiny of Eritrea.\\nThere is also another reason for paying particular attention to the political \\nparties in general and the Unionist Party in particular. The events preceding the \\nUN resolution, I believe, can be best understood when studied in the context of \\nEritrean political responses. Moreover, a study of the Eritrean political parties \\nand their constantly shifting alliances provides a continuity as well as back-\\nground to the main theme of the book, namely the rise and the fall of the feder-\\nation between Eritrea and Ethiopia.\\nThe story of how the federation came into existence and the first three years \\nof the life of the federation are treated in the third chapter. The documentation \\nis exclusively archival and given the nature of its collection (by consulates and \\nembassies) the material is indeed satisfactory. Already in the first three years of \\nthe federation, we notice that the former members of the UP, now in govern-\\nment positions, were busy undermining the federation and calling for its disso-\\nlution. It is complete union that they were after and they were frustrated by the \\nfederal arrangement which they considered as foreign to their political concep-\\ntion and vocabulary. We also see clearly the transformation of some of the \\nearlier political parties, namely the Moslem League, into champions of the fed-\\neration.\\nOnly three years after the launching of the federal arrangement Eritrea was \\nfor all intents and purposes a part of Ethiopia. In the process of dismantling the \\nfederation, the UP, now heavily dominating the Eritrean government, had a \\ngreat role to play.\\nThe protracted struggle of the ML against the Eritrean and Ethiopian gov-\\nernments is the main emphasis of the fourth chapter. Once again, the British \\narchival documentation allows a satisfactory reconstruction. The continuity \\nbetween the pre-federation agitation and post-federation protest can be clearly \\nfollowed as well as established. The role of the Ethiopian government, firstly as \\na federal partner and secondly as the supreme authority over the country \\nincluding Eritrea, is dealt with but perhaps not to the desired extent. It was more \\ndifficult for the British diplomatic corps to gather information inside Ethiopia \\nsince most of the decisions were taken by Emperor Haile Sellassie himself. \\nMoreover, the Ethiopians did not have any serious worries as the federation was \\nslowly but surely being dissolved, largely by Eritrean forces themselves. The \\nchapter is concluded by a short discussion on the reasons for the dissolution of \\nthe federation and the role of the Ethiopian government in the process.\\nThe unfolding of events after the incorporation of Eritrea into the Ethiopian \\nempire (1962) is discussed in chapter five. The Eritreans initiated armed oppo-\\nsition against the dissolution of the federation but were divided as to the nature \\nof the goals of the opposition as well as to who would assume power after the \\nexpulsion of Ethiopian rule. The issues which surfaced in the late 1940s contin-\\n36 Chapter One\\nued \\nto dominate the relations between the various Eritrean nationalist armed \\nforces. By the 1970s all Eritrean armed opposition organizations had modified \\ntheir political demands to that of complete independence. Yet as the chapter \\ndemonstrates, the Eritrean nationalist forces were divided into two irreconcil-\\nable camps which involved an articulation of the image of an independent \\nEritrea. Would Eritrea be part of the Arab and Moslem world, as the ELF argued \\nor would Eritrea continue to be dominated by the Christian Eritreans with \\nstrong cultural and economic links with the central parts of Ethiopia? The latter \\nposition, argued by the EPLF was eventually to win.\\nThe issue which had united the Eritrean nationalist forces since the 1970s \\nwas the independence of Eritrea. On this issue, there was a clear discontinuity \\nof political objectives. Whereas there was a clear continuity between the ML and \\nthe ELF, there was no such continuity of objectives between the defunct UP and \\nthe EPLF. The EPLF cannot be described as a successor of the Unionist Party, \\nalthough it promoted some of its programme, namely the hegemonic position \\nof the Christian Eritreans (Tigreans) in the country.\\nThe final short chapter attempts to sketch the challenges both internal and \\nexternal which the newly independent state of Eritrea is likely to face in the fore-\\nseeable future.\\nBibliograph\\ny\\nArchival Sources\\nPublic Record Office, Foreign Office Files (F0371) London, United Kingdom.\\nPublic Record Office, War Office Files (WO230/168) London, United Kingsom.\\nPublic Record Office, War Office Files (W097) London, United Kingsom.\\nArchivio Storico dell\\'Africa Italiana, Archivio Eritrea (ASMAI, AE) Rome, Italy.\\nArchivio Storico dell\\'Africa Italiana (ASMAI), Affari Politici, Direzione Generale,  \\n1942-46.\\nArchivio Storico dell\\'Africa Italiana (ASMAI), Direzione Africa Orientale, 1946-50.\\nArchivio Storico del Ministero degli Affari Esteri (ASMAE), Affari Politici, 1946-50.\\nInstitute of Ethiopian Studies, Addis Ababa University, (IES, Nega Haile Sellassie  \\nPapers).\\nContemporary periodicals\\nEritrean Weekly News (EWN), 1942-1953.\\nZemen Biweekly, 1953-55.\\nEthiopia Weekly, 1947-50.\\nNew Times and Ethiopia News, 1947-56.\\nSelect Bibliography\\nAdou, A.
